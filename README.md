# ECE_322_Lab1

Lab 1 serves as an introduction to semi-formal Black Box testing techniques such as Failure (dirty) testing, Error Guessing, and Partition Based testing which are used to discover errors in provided software, Calculator.jar & Triangle.jar.


## Task1:

Task 1 revolves around the provided exectuable Calculator.jar which is a simple implementation of a base-10 calculator that provides simple arithimetic operations, all through a GUI. Test cases are developed using Failure testing and Error Guessing in an attempt to discover errors in the software. Test cases that discover potential errors are highlighted in the report. 


## Task2:

Task 2 revolves around the Triangle.jar executable. This command line program takes in three integer inputs, which are the 3 side lengths of a triangle and classifys the triangle as scalence, equilateral, isosceles, or gives an error message. First the equivalence classes are defined and then using these valid/ invalid equiv. classes a test suite is given as seen in the Lap Report.
